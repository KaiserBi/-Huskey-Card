# -Huskey-Card

## Introduction

This is a project where I have made a custom PCB card initially seeking to replace the University of Washington Husky Card with a better appearance. 

Through researching about the RFID and NFC stuff, I found it kind of hard for me to completely design and debug a coil and an RFID chip as an inovice to engineering. After a while I realized 2 things: 1: The husky card's RFID function was only used for U-pass, and daily purchases relied on the magnetic strip on the card. 2:Making husky card replicas could get me into trouble with the UW HFS, which is a thing I would certainly avoid. 

Therefore, this project turned into a decorative artifact production project. 

## Final Results
