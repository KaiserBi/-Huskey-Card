# -Huskey-Card

## Introduction

This is a project where I have made a custom PCB card initially seeking to replace the University of Washington Husky Card with a better appearance. 
For the appearance, I choose to use black solder masks with ENIG.

Through researching about the RFID and NFC stuff, I found it kind of hard for me to completely design and debug a coil and an RFID chip as an inovice to engineering. After a while I realized 2 things: 1: The husky card's RFID function was only used for U-pass, and daily purchases relied on the magnetic strip on the card. 2:Making husky card replicas could get me into trouble with the UW HFS, which is a thing I would certainly avoid. 

Therefore, this project turned into a decorative artifact production project. 

## Things Used

I used canva, an online design website for the cherry blossom UW logo part. Then I transferred it to inkscape for tracing it into SVG. 

For the PCB, I designed it with Kicad and placed an order on JLC for the manufacturing.


## Final Results

### This is the front of the card, the UW logo with cherry blossoms was designed by me.

## Important Notice

1.Although this repository seemed very new, this was actually a project I have made in the summer

2.I have some of the PCBs printed out, and feel free to contact me for a demo of the actual production for you in-person(if you are at the UW).
